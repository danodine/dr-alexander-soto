# React â€” Dr. Alexander Soto (Lite)

This is a React + Vite port. This LITE package excludes heavy assets to avoid download size limits.

1) Download this LITE pack and the ASSETS pack.
2) Unzip both.
3) Move the `public/assets/` folder from the ASSETS pack into this project's `public/`.

Run:
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
